	* update module source code 
	* add fa_aacenc project (now support mono and stereo encoding, but need to do 
	  more test, and I will add ms encoding and do speed optimization, now is 
	  very slow, I don't like this speed). 
	* I think the fa_aacenc audio quality performance is better than faac (I tested)
	* package the fft, mdct, resample, fir and upload
